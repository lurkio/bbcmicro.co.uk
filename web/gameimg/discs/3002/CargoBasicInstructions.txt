@ = Display instruction pages

On the screen when it asks "Select Mode"

F2 = Programming Mode. Press F to finish this when you've finished! Arrow keys may work to edit/amend instructions.

F4 = Exec Mode. Press this to carry out the instructions set in Programming Mode.

F6 = Single Step Mode. Almost the same as Exec Mode (do not confuse this with Immediate Mode!) , you just have to press a key to move between each pre-programmed instruction rather than with 'Exec Mode' where it does them all in one go for you.

F8 = Edit Mode. Allows editing of instructions programmed in F2/Programming Mode.

F10 = Immediate Mode. Very easy, typing in each instruction and it immediately obeys them

The best way to think of this is: F4 is just like running a program as normal where as F6 is the same with TRACE ON enabled, so it 'steps' through each instruction with a "wait for a key-press" between each instruction.


Pressing F will usually exit/finish each mode and allow you to select a different one. Pressing Q will usually return to the main choice page (asking if you wanted sound etc) , if you go this far then you may lose any programmed instructions.
