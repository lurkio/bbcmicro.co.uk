These are due to Mick re-posting them after finding the instruction inlays.

Replacement SSD for Disc999-EscapeFromCastleDracula.ssd, which is now renamed Disc999-EscapeFromCastleDraculaSTD.ssd as it saves to disc.

I have included a zip file with 43 images that me and Chet "improved" by adding instructions to etc.
I previously sent these, but cannot remember if they will have been over-written when I sent the complete set of games recently after Mick did all his changes??
Just overwrite any images with these ones please.

Lee.
